## About The Project

This project has resulted from a hobby DIY VAN project to combine the variety of displays and hardware in the VAN and caravan area and to make the easy installation possible. 

We took care of a simple startup to make this project also accessible for non-programmers. Take a look at the Quickstarts. 

For the developers is a Node-RED backend and various Python scripts for expansion and improvement ready.

## Installation Script

# Supported Devices
  ## Battery
  - Bluetooth BMS:<br>
    - JBD BMS SYSTEMS e.g. Liontron Batterys 
    - DALY BMS (in development)
    - VICTRON SMART SHUNT BLE **in development**
  - wired:<br>
    - VICTRON SMART SHUNT VE.Direct
    - DALY BMS UART BLUETOOTH (6pin)
    - DALY BMS UART MONIT (3pin)
    - JBD BMS UART PORT
  
  - analog Shunt:<br>
    - Measuring the voltage drop across a SHUNT using the ads1115 on the VAN PI relayboard and the VAN PI HAT. Voltage measurement is done using a voltage divider. A Python script reads the data and makes it accessible by providing a Bottle webserver (port 8080), Node-RED then checks the endpoint(s) to get the values. Data remains in the RAM and is written to the SD-Card every 5min.
  
  
  - ESP32-C3 INA226 SHUNT: <br>
    - standalone Esp32-c3 based WIFI Shunt. Measures the current, SOC, Battery Voltage. MQTT and BLE will be supported  **in development**
  
  
  ## Water
  - resistance sensor:<br>
  on the Relayboard and the HAT is a voltage divider section to read the variable resistance of any resistance sensor you want to use. It uses the same ADS1115 as the analog shunt. The shunt Pythonscript also reads the ads1115 fot the waterlevels. 
  - capacitve sensor:<br>
  The Relayboard and the HAT have a jumper section to remove the voltage divider section to read voltage directly up to 3.3V to the ADS1115. 
  typical sensors:
    - Votronic FL
    - Votronic 15-50K, 12-24K 
    - CBE sensors
    
  - Flow sensors:<br>
  you can also connect flow sensors with gpio. Node-RED will then access the sensors directly).
  
  - other: <br>
    - Gobius Pro **in development** 
    
  - Top/Bottom calibration, Votronic direct calibration (2,4V), 10 Point Calibration **in development**
    
  
  ## Heater
  
 - Autoterm 2D/4D (twin kit **in development**)
 - Webasto W-Bus <=3.5 - *tested with a Thermo Top V water heater* 
 - Chinese Diesel Heater *blue wire* - Arduino NANO Serial Interface
 - Truma INET **in development**
 - LF BROS via 433mhz (needs to be activated in the backend since v1.1.0, WiringPI may need to be installed)
 
   
  ## Displays
  
  - HDMI: <br>
  VAN PI OS is based on a headless Debian/Raspbian image. You can install the software stack on Ubuntu/Debian based desktop versions with the install script and then use the normal webinterface as your display. Please be aware that manual adjustments may need to be done.
  
  - Nextion via UART:<br>
  
  With the RJ45 UART adapter we can connect a Nextion display to the Relayboard/HAT via an RJ45 ethernet cable. It provides 5V DC and 3.3V UART for communication. We do not have an official VAN PI Nextion image yet. You can find information about the protocol in the docs to build your own .tft file. 
  
  - Sonoff NS Wifi Panel: <br>
   We support the NS Panel and have prepared a VAN PI tft file for it. The data is send with MQTT. Please check this installation quide **in development**
